  <a href="https://archive.org/details/MuggeridgeMalcolmChroniclesOfWastedTime"><h3>Chronicles of Wasted Time by Malcolm Muggeridge</h3></a>
  <div><p>Recommended by Mencius Moldbug, <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/11/book-review-chronicles-of-wasted-time/">via Scott Alexander</a>:</p><p>One of my posts on reactionaries provoked a very irregular email conversation with Mencius Moldbug, in which his responses to a good number of my objections were along the lines of “I think you’ll find that will make much more sense if you read this 18th century Italian primer on diplomacy” or “The best way to figure that out is to read this 400 page testament by a Prussian military officer.” Finally I asked him to suggest the one book he thought would be most interesting to me, and he chose Chronicles of Wasted Time, the autobiography of Malcolm Muggeridge.</p><p>It was a good choice, and not just because its title appropriately described my expectations about reading 500-page books on the recommendation of Mencius Moldbug. Muggeridge is a clear reactionary, but one with the personal and historical credentials to pull it off with the utmost class and credibility.</p><p>He describes his birth in 1903 to a family of committed British socialists. Their heroes were Karl Marx, George Bernard Shaw, and Fabian leaders Sidney and Beatrice Webb. These last two I had only the slightest familiarity with, but Muggeridge paints a picture of them as the progressive titans of his day, boasting a combination of Chomsky’s intellectual leadership with the Clintons’ network and political acumen. Throughout Muggeridge’s youth, his family would host meetings, sing socialist songs, run for various minor offices on the socialist ticket, and exchange correspondence with intellectual worthies. They even flirt with, though never quite join, an experimental commune being set up in their area, about which Muggeridge has the best stories.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/BeveridgeAlbertAbrahamLincoln"><h3>Abraham Lincoln by Albert Beveridge</h3></a>
  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2009/03/gentle-introduction-to-unqualified.html">Recommended by Moldbug</a>:</p><p>The titanic book that smashed my delusions and forced me to recognize the awful reality of the era was, without a doubt, Albert Beveridge&rsquo;s unfinished Abraham Lincoln (1928). Here is a <a href="http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jala/25.2/braeman.html">review</a> by a modern historian, with whose few negative comments I would quarrel if it mattered. Beveridge died before completing his third volume, which would have started in 1858, but it scarcely matters. If time is short, you can just read the second volume. Also excellent, and even more brutal, is Edgar Lee Masters&rsquo; Lincoln the Man (1931).</p><p>Almost all Lincoln biographies are completely worthless. They explain Lincoln as a saint, rather than the extraordinarily talented politician he was. Their method is as follows: tell us what Lincoln said, assume that he was saying what he was thinking, then praise this noble thought. When Lincoln emits &ldquo;darky&rdquo; jokes or other crass noises, this can be put down to necessary political opportunism, in which he had to engage if he was to fulfill his Father&rsquo;s mission. (Note that the same method, with the same results, can be used for Barack Obama.)</p><p>Masters and Beveridge put Lincoln in his political context, and they explain his speeches as what they were: not thoughts but actions, with intended results. Masters was America&rsquo;s leading poet and Beveridge a major senator, and neither of them have any patience with the &ldquo;great man&rdquo; act. Their books are hard to find, unfortunately, but there&rsquo;s always interlibrary loan.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/ZweigStefanErasmusAndTheRightToHeresy"><h3>The Right To Heresy: Castellio Against Calvin by Stefan Zweig</h3></a>
  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/06/cryptocalvinism-slightly-tweaked.html">Recommended by Moldbug</a></p><p>For me, Calvinism is a system of government which aims at total righteousness. As Stefan Zweig describes it, in his wonderfully dramatic The Right To Heresy: Castellio Against Calvin,</p>
<blockquote><p>A master of the art of organization, Calvin had been able to transform a whole city, a whole State, whose numerous burghers had hitherto been freemen, into a rigidly obedient machine; had been able to extirpate independence, and to lay an embargo on freedom of thought in favor of his own exclusive doctrine. The powers of the State were under his supreme control; as wax in his hands were the various authorities, Town Council and Consistory, university and law-courts, finance and morality, the written and the spoken and even the secretly whispered word.</p>
</blockquote><p>Zweig describes the Consistory, Geneva&rsquo;s religious police</p>
<blockquote><p>The members of this moral Cheka thrust fingers into every pie. They felt the women&rsquo;s dresses to see whether their skirts were not too long or too short, whether these garments had superfluous frills or dangerous slits. The police carefully inspected the coiffure, to see that it did not tower too high; they counted the rings on the victim&rsquo;s fingers, and looked to see how many pairs of shoes were in the cupboard. From the bedroom they passed on to the kitchen table, to ascertain whether the prescribed diet was not being exceeded by a soup or a course of meat, or whether sweets and jams were hidden away somewhere.</p>
</blockquote><p>And the burning of Servetus:</p>
<blockquote><p>The chains attached to the stake were wound four or five times around it and around the poor wretch&rsquo;s wasted body. Between this and the chains, the executioner&rsquo;s assistants then inserted the book and the manuscript which Servetus had sent to Calvin under seal to ask Calvin&rsquo;s fraternal opinion upon it. Finally, in scorn, there was pressed upon the martyr&rsquo;s brow a crown of leaves impregnated with sulphur. The preliminaries were over. The executioner kindled the faggots and the murder began.</p><p>When the flames rose around him, Servetus uttered so dreadful a cry that many of the onlookers turned their eyes away from the pitiful sight. Soon the smoke interposed a veil in front of the writhing body, but the yells of agony grew louder and louder, until at length came an imploring scream: &ldquo;Jesus, Son of the everlasting God, have pity on me!&rdquo; The struggle with death lasted half an hour. Then the flames abated, the smoke dispersed, and attached to the blackened stake there remained, above the glowing embers, a black, sickening, charred mass, which had lost human semblance.</p>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/FergussonErnaGuatemala"><h3>Guatemala by Erna Fergusson</h3></a>
  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/08/america-vampire-of-world-part-1.html">Recommended by Moldbug</a>:</p><p>There is also the corporate domination of Latin America, eg, the relationship between United Fruit and Guatemala. Several major university departments are devoted to this exploitative horror, in which commercial stability and political stability reinforced each other. Here, for example, is an American visitor&rsquo;s description of Guatemala City in 1935:</p>
<blockquote><p>Guatemala [City] is a clean, fresh little city of a hundred and fifty thousand people. [&hellip;] Traffic rules are numerous and well-observed. At each intersection a driver slows down, honks ever so gently, and waits until the policeman signals him on with a whistle as dulcet as the motor&rsquo;s horn. If he leaves town, an officer takes his number, telephones it ahead; and if his spin has been a trifle too dizzy, the speeder finds himself arrested at his destination. It would be redundant to state that accidents are rare. Aside from what the Europeanized minority needs, everything that Guatemala produces or uses comes into the great market behind the Cathedral. Need I say that it is quiet and orderly, clean and pleasant? All the Guatemalan tribes converge there, and its sights and sounds and smells together reflect a wavering and imperfect image; but still an image of the whole country. No Indian lives on too distant a mountain to make his way sooner or later to the capital, bringing the wooly blankets he wears at home; or in too trackless a jungle to turn up some day in El Mercado Central with an ocelot skin or a choice bit of alligator meat for sale. Most Indians come to town in typical dress, for every hamlet has its own: costumes so striking in color and style that they reduce the whole correct city and vapid white race to a paltry background for their display.</p>
</blockquote><p>Present-day visitors to Guatemala City may think of many adjectives, but I&rsquo;m not sure &ldquo;clean,&rdquo; &ldquo;fresh,&rdquo; &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; or &ldquo;orderly&rdquo; would be among them. I suspect standards of dress among the Indians have slipped a little, as well. And as for the &ldquo;vapid white race,&rdquo; most of them probably live in Miami by now. Some might describe this as progress. I do wonder what Ms. Fergusson, who is quite liberal and seems to have friends at the Carnegie Foundation, would make of it.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/WaughEvelynRobberyUnderLawTheMexicanObjectLesson"><h3>Robbery Under Law: The Mexican Object Lesson by Waugh, Evelyn</h3></a>
  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2009/08/from-cromer-to-romer-and-back-again.html">Recommended by Molbug</a>: Robbery Under Law (1939), is not only the first work to describe the coming Third World, but also the best. Read it.</p><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2009/09/honduran-rebellion-or-states-invisible.html">And again by Moldbug</a>: One of the many fascinating details in Waugh&rsquo;s Robbery Under Law, essential for anyone interested in this destructive process, is the popularity of Fascist ideology in Mexico in the late 1930s, such as the Falange and their concept of Hispanidad. This was of course nothing but the same intellectual attraction of power - taking a very different direction. Alas, this fabulous alternate reality of Mexican Nazis received its fatal blow at Stalingrad.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/GreyViscountOfFallodonTwentyFiveYears"><h3>Twenty Five Years 1892-1916 by Viscount Grey of Fallodon</h3></a>
  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/04/open-letter-pt-2-more-historical.html">Recommended by Moldbug</a>:</p><p>Obviously, this is propaganda. But one bit of real history that I can recommend to anyone is the viewpoint of the fellow on the other side of this &ldquo;encirclement&rdquo; business: Lord Grey of Fallodon. If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered who said &ldquo;the lights are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime,&rdquo; Lord Grey is your man. His memoirs are extremely readable - indeed, reading them one sees just why we have not seen the lamps lit again. There is simply no individual of Grey&rsquo;s caliber, politician or civil servant, in the whole government racket these days.</p><p>Needless to say, to Lord Grey (writing after the war), no one would ever dream of trying to encircle Germany. Rather, the German militarists are paranoid and jingoistic, constantly trying to enhance their domestic political position by triggering European crises. And indeed the pot that boiled over at Sarajevo was by no means the first such crisis - Agadir is a fine example. The British, on the other hand, are simply doing their best to keep the peace. In the end they failed, Germany attacked Belgium without provocation, and British honor bound her to respond.</p><p>I find Grey completely credible. I have no reservations about his sincerity. He certainly strikes me as a far more trustworthy character than the slippery Palmerston, who really was a bit of a snake. </p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/BallGeorgeThePastHasAnotherPatternMemoirs"><h3>The Past Has Another Pattern: The Memoirs of George Ball</h3></a>
  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/11/president-obama-with-little-perspective.html">Recommended by Moldbug</a>:</p><p>To illustrate, I give you George Ball. You&rsquo;ve almost certainly never heard of George Ball, but in his heyday he had more power than anyone in the US has today. I&rsquo;m dead serious. For example, if Ball&rsquo;s autobiography is to be believed (and I believe it), in collaboration with Jean Monnet he was largely responsible for the birth of the monster we know and love as the European Union.</p><p>Here is how Ball describes the vibe of &rsquo;33, when the Cathedral first stormed and sacked the city on the river. At the time, he has just graduated from law school:</p>
<blockquote><p>Washington was swarming with young lawyers, economists, bankers, and professors-in-exile, all bent on reorganizing the cosmos, rearranging the stars and planets. Programmed like a computer with bits and tags of literature, I mouthed Wordsworth&rsquo;s famous apostrophe to the early weeks of the French Revolution: &ldquo;Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,/ But to be young was very heaven!&rdquo;</p><p>The times were ebullient, and yeast was in the air. Each morning we awoke to read with excitement of Roosevelt&rsquo;s latest outrageous move. It was épater les bourgeois in political and economic terms or - more precisely for us - it was épater les vieillards, a form of exercise that inevitably lifts the hearts of anyone under thirty. The old order had discredited itself; we would conjure up a new and better one in its place. </p>

His sole mission was to secure critical supplies for waging the war against the Nazis. Chasing item after crucial item, he learned and became fascinated with the workings of a true free market economy.</p><p>After the war he set out on a single minded mission to create the United States of Europe out of the chaos left by the war. Fighting centuries of division, animosity, and separatism, Jean doggedly advanced his concept of a free market covering the entire map of Europe. He was convinced that this would result in a renaissance of European industry and commerce, and the hearts and minds of Europeans would follow their pocketbooks.</p><p>Told in a very matt-of-fact manner, his persistence and uncompromising attention to even the slightest detail gives insight as to how he succeeded in planting the seeds of the modern European Community. His influence was so great that the Economist magazine has consistently advocated that the new European Community common currency be called the &ldquo;Monnet.&rdquo;</p></div>

  <div><p>“This book,” Mr. Bailyn writes, “depicts the fortunes of a conservative in a time of radical upheaval and deals with problems of public disorder and ideological commitment.” It is at the same time a dramatic account of the origins of the American Revolution from the viewpoint, not of the winners who became the Founding Fathers, but of the losers, the Loyalists. By portraying the ordeal of the last civilian royal governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Bailyn explains “what the human reality was against which the victors struggled” and in doing so makes the story of the Revolution fuller and more comprehensible.</p></div>

  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2009/04/from-luigi-barzinis-europeans.html">Recommended by Mencius Moldbug</a>:</p><p>Though we may never know why, in the &rsquo;80s it was easier for a rich man to pass through the eye of a camel than for anyone to write a decent book. Even Hunter Thompson was unmanned by the age - I mean, really, The Curse of Lono?</p><p>So it&rsquo;s with some surprise that I present this selection from Luigi Barzini&rsquo;s The Europeans - copyright, 1983. The exception is easy to explain. Barzini, a hereditary aristocrat of Italian liberal journalism, was no parbaked Boomer, but a man of the Interbellum. Moreover, the effort must have exhausted the old lion - he seems to have died in 1984.</p><p>Before we read Barzini, we need to be clear on the context: Barzini was no reactionary, nor even a conservative. He was a liberal, an Anglophile and Americanist, educated at Columbia, and an unabashed fan of European unification under American political traditions. But he was a liberal of the old world - a considerably looser straitjacket than the word at present implies. Moreover, when he wrote The Europeans he was neither young nor dense, and Conquest&rsquo;s law had done its usual work.</p></div>

  <div><p><a href="https://foseti.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/review-of-out-of-bondage-by-elizabeth-bentley/">Recommended and reviewed by Foseti</a>:</p><p>Ms Bentley was an Communist Party USA (CPUSA) member who was an active Soviet spy for most of a decade. Her story is perhaps a micro-version of the entire relationship between American Communism (aka progressivism) and the Soviet variety.</p><p>Many Americans joined the CPUSA and many spied for the Soviets. Many (if not all) also eventually broke with the Soviets. Obviously, these people were not all identical. They did not all come from the same background. However, when one reads their memoirs, one notices a lot of similarities. Ms Bentley is, in my opinion, the quintessential American Communist. In a way, her story is the story of them all and it’s laid out – in detail and in a matter of fact way – in this nearly forgotten book. Conservatives want you to remember Whittaker Chambers and progressives want you to remember Joseph McCarthy (if they want to remember anything at all). I would like you to remember Elizabeth Bentley.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/BerrierHilaireDuBackgroundToBetrayalTheTragedyOfVietnam"><h3>Background to Betrayal: The Tragedy of Vietname by Hilaire Du Berrier</h3></a>
  <div><p>Originally recommended by Mencius Moldbug:</p><p>The third is a cute little paperback from 1963, issued by a publisher called &ldquo;Western Islands,&rdquo; which seems to have been associated in some way, shape or form with (gasp) the John Birch Society. The author is Hilaire du Berrier, the book is Background to Betrayal, the subject is Vietnam. Du Berrier was a supporter of one of the least-beloved regimes in modern Vietnamese history, the postcolonial French puppet state of the Emperor Bao Dai. As such his critiques of Ngo Dinh Diem and his supporters in the American liberal establishment are quite unusual, sometimes oddly mirroring those of Diem&rsquo;s enemies to the left, and contradicting neocon revisionist work such as Mark Moyar&rsquo;s Triumph Forsaken. Amazon&rsquo;s current price on this book is 99 cents, which has to be a bargain for anything so unusual. Who is most reliable? Du Berrier, Moyar, or Halberstam, Sheehan &amp; Co.? Or do they all have something to offer?</p><p>Also <a href="https://foseti.wordpress.com/2008/12/08/review-of-background-to-betrayal-by-hilaire-du-berrier/" rel="nofollow">recommended and reviewed by Foseti</a>:</p><p>This book will challenge common perceptions on both sides of the political aisle in America today. My beliefs about how the world – and American politics more specifically – works have changed a lot recently. This book will help someone on a similar journey, but I don’t think it is the best place to start.</p><p>My journey started with this book and then a whole lot of research to determine whether Mr Chambers was correct or whether everything else I had learned about the era of the Cold War was correct – there was no room for a middle ground. I found that Mr Chambers was correct, and my mind was blown. Many other authors have helped with my awakening – including this one – but I think Witness is a better place to start than Background to Betrayal. Regardless of where you start, you’re in for a long and at times unpleasant journey.</p><p>Betrayal is the story of the political maneuvering that led to the Vietnam War. The book focuses on various political leaders in Vietnam and their backers in the United States (and to a lesser extent France and the Soviets). The author’s background is truly impressive (this does no justice to it – perhaps I’ll add to it). The author was in Vietnam well prior to the war and saw the tragic political events unfold before his eyes.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/BosherJFFrenchRevolution"><h3>French Revolution by JF Bosher.</h3></a>
  <div><p>Recommended by Mencius Moldbug. From a GoodReads review:</p><p>Bosher’s “The French Revolution” shatters one of the most enduring myths of modernity and post-modernity: the righteousness and inevitability of the Revolution. A scholarly and entertaining read, this work challenges many firmly held beliefs about how King Louis XVI fell from power, who were the revolutionaries, and whether it had to happen. To summarize Bosher all too briefly, the French Revolution did not have to occur and would not have likely happened had Louis XVI acted more firmly and less liberally. Because Louis XVI was attempting to act gently and progressively, he lost the confidence of the public. The populace, however, did not really care. One of the most useful distinctions that Bosher makes is between the public – the literate, urban, and socially conscious – and the populace – the peasants and ordinary Frenchmen who only cared for their own. Whereas most histories would have you believe that the peasants overthrew a harsh monarchy, according to Bosher the peasants only really cared about being fed and keeping their local customs. Moreover, classes as we understand them today did not exist in France at the time. Instead, there existed a plurality of societies that coexisted and intermingled in one area led by a monarch whom most people respected until the early 1790’s. Bosher goes into great detail to show that the French Revolution that most know never happened. Anyone interested in better understanding how this profound event actually transpired ought to read this excellent work.</p></div>

This spree, committed by black members of an offshoot of the Muslim religion, was done in an attempt for the murderers to win “Death Angel” status. This dubious honor was given to any “true believer” who murdered a certain number of white children, white women, or white men, or a combination of the three.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/FischerFritzGermanysAimsInTheFirstWorldWar"><h3>Germany’s Aims in the First World War by Fritz Fischer</h3></a>
  <div><p>This book made the most extensive argument for Germany being to blame for the outbreak of World War I. Most popular books from more recent decades that also blame Germany, draw almost entirely from Fischer’s work. From a review:</p><p>Fischer’s works regarding Germany and the First World War is a must for anyone interested in the events and decisions leading up to 1914 and for anyone interested in historiography. When Fischer unleashed this book in 1961, it created a tidal wave in the German historian community. Germany’s Aims… challenged traditional views regarding the origins of the First World War and developed conclusions that were devastating to the reputations and memories of individuals and an entire nation.</p><p>The traditional view regarding the causes of the Great War, as explained by prominent German historians on the subject like Gehard Ritter, was that the leaders of Germany felt surrounded by the allied nations and thus entered the war for defensive reasons. Most historians outside of Germany agreed that Germany was not the sole culprit of 1914. The “guilt clause” in the Versailles Treaty is still almost universally condemned. Through an exhaustive study of documents out of Germany, Fritz Fischer comes up with a different–and shocking–conclusion: Germany was to blame.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/FreedomAtMidnight"><h3>Freedom at Midnight by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins</h3></a>
  <div><p>Recommended and reviewed by Foseti:</p><p>I’ve been searching for good history books on India or China for a long time. This book is the first one I’ve read that I would call good. The others that I have read would charitably have been called “scholarly.” That description means that the books had all of the relevant material, but, unfortunately, the books were written by someone without the ability to write in an engaging way. In short, the books were just a dry summary of events.</p><p>This book at times seemed like it might turn in the other direction. There were several times I was nervous that I was just going to get a well-written, embellished story, instead of the facts. I don’t think it ever happened though. Before I started reading the book, I was concerned that the portrayal would not be balanced. In general, I thought the portrayal fair.</p></div>

  <div><p>Mentioned by Mencius Moldbug:</p><p>I am reminded of an episode in one of the few good books I read in an undergraduate class, the autobiography of Yukichi Fukuzawa. Fukuzawa is serving as an interpreter for one of the first major Japanese embassies to Europe. He is perfectly conversant with European culture, albeit through diligent study in late Tokugawa Japan, but the bigwigs in his party are not.</p><p>Unfortunately I do not have my copy of Fukuzawa handy, but one of his bigwigs, visiting the Netherlands, is amazed that foreigners are allowed to buy land in Amsterdam. He asks his Dutch interlocutor: what if a foreigner bought a large area of land in the middle of the city, and erected a fortress? Would the government permit this?</p><p>The poor Dutchman, of course, is reduced to asking: why would they do that? Indeed it is almost impossible to convey to the ignorant samurai why they wouldn’t. He has basically failed to understand the entire concept of Europe. In fact, in order to explain why they wouldn’t, you more or less have to explain the entire concept of Europe.</p></div>

  <div><p>Recommended by Paul Graham.</p><p>From an Amazon review:</p><p>Professor Moses Hadas, one of the preeminent classicists of the mid 20th century, prepared this book. It is prepared, rather than written by Professor Hadas, because for the most part it is a compilation of excerpts from classic Latin sources, such as Tactitus and Suetonius, with short bridging paragraphs by professor Hadas. This approach has the benefit of providing the English translation of the source, rather than a historian&rsquo;s interpretation of the source. However, the tradeoff is a lack of a more cohesive approach to Roman history. Other histories generally have a constant coordinating theme upon which to hang the narrative. This book uses the original sources to tell the story, but since the book is less than 300 pages long Professor Hadas has had to be very selective, and this makes the narrative somewhat choppy: very detailed in some places, unduly sparse in others.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/HartBHLiddellTheGermanGeneralsTalk"><h3>The German Generals Talk edited by BH Liddell Hart</h3></a>
  <div><p>From an Amazon review:</p><p>B.H. Liddell Hart was one of the foremost military historians and theoreticians of the 20th Century. His interwar writings on the future of armored warfare were read down to the last period by Heinz Guderian, who used them (and others) as the basis of Germany&rsquo;s &ldquo;armored idea&rdquo; well before Adolf Hitler assumed the chancellorship in 1933. Ironically, Hart&rsquo;s conclusions &ndash; that tanks should be deployed en masse rather than distributed evenly among infantry formations to give them &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; &ndash; were ignored by his own side, and it was not until 1940 that he could point to the crushing Allied defeat in France and say, &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo;</p><p>Shortly after the war, Hart was granted access to many of the seniormost German generals in Western captivity: his interviews with these gentlemen constitute the basis for &ldquo;The German Generals Talk&rdquo;, a terse, easily readable and absolutely fascinating must-have for historians, history buffs, professional soldiers and armchair generals.</p><p>Hart starts with a brief overview of the German army&rsquo;s officer corps pre-Hitler, its relationship to the NS state and the development of the armored concept. He follows with a history of the war through the eyes of the particular field marshals and generals he was interviewing &ndash; Blumentritt, Rundstedt, Thoma, Kleist, Heinrici, Manteuffel, Student, etc. Interspersed with this are his own analyses and conclusions on such matters as Hitler&rsquo;s leadership, the quality of the Red Army, and so on.</p><p>Hart unmistakably had a sizable ego, no doubt stroked thoroughly by the admiration with which he was regarded, and I can&rsquo;t disagree with those who feel his interviews with the officers in question, as well as his conclusions, tended to be conducted in such a way as to validate his prewar writings and ideas. He unsparing with self-praise and occasionally breaks up the narraitive to show how his prognostications were always &ldquo;proven&rdquo; right. This is a bit annoying but it doesn&rsquo;t detract much from the enjoyability of the book.</p></div>

  <div><p><a href="https://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/review-of-france-the-tragic-years-by-sisley-huddleston/">Recommended by Foseti</a>:</p><p>The book explains the lead up to WWII, the position of France during the war, and the peace that follows the war. Huddleston is an interesting guy. He was plugged into various diplomatic circles, he apparently worked at the League of Nations for a while, and – most importantly – he was correct about a lot of issues over a long period of time.</p><p>The book really shines when he focuses on France during the occupation – a subject about which I knew very little. I’ll spend most of the review on that topic.</p><p>Diplomats – including Huddleston – knew that the Soviets were negotiating a peace pact with the Germans as early as 1939. As one Russian diplomat said, “The USSR was born out of the first war, and a second would end in the Soveitization of Europe.” If Germany went to war with Britain and France, all potential outcomes were good for the Soviets.</p><p>Anyway, interesting diplomatic factoids aside, our story really starts at Dunkirk. Dunkirk is usually considered a miracle for the British. Huddleston’s take is quite different.</p></div>

  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-to-occupy-and-govern-foreign.html">Recommended by Moldbug</a>:</p><p>Specifically, all Young British officers and administrators in New Persia are assigned the following reading list&hellip;Kedourie, The Chatham House Version.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start off with a passage from Kedourie that more or less tells the story. This is from the essay The Kingdom of Iraq: A Retrospect, describing the Sharifian monarchy of Iraq that was installed by the British in 1921 and overthrown in 1958. Needless to say, next to the present American puppet regime, the Kingdom of Iraq looks like the Prussia of Frederick the Great. But Kedourie&rsquo;s words still apply, squared.</p><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/09/america-vampire-of-world-part-2.html">Recommended by Moldbug</a>: So we see that it&rsquo;s quite reasonable to say not only that the fireman has been pouring gasoline on the flames for the last sixty years, but that he in fact started the fire. It is not merely that the diplomatic &ldquo;dark matter&rdquo; of USG&rsquo;s intervention keeps the Arab-Israeli conflict alive. It&rsquo;s that Wilsonian (first British, later American) sponsorship of Arab nationalism essentially informed the Arabs that fighting - as opposed to either (a) accomodating themselves to the newfound diversity of Jewish immigration, or (b) leaving - was an option, and was likely to succeed. (Note that no one has informed white Californians that pogroms are an option for dealing with Mexican immigration, a small blessing we must nonetheless be thankful for.) If you doubt this story, it is set out in great academic detail in Elie Kedourie&rsquo;s The Chatham House Version, which is simply an essential work for anyone interested in the problem.</p></div>

  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2009/09/seasteading-without-that-warm-glow.html">Recommended by Moldbug</a>:</p><p>If you&rsquo;re curious about the mind of man under socialism, a long book but well worth reading is Victor Klemperer&rsquo;s diary from his East German period, published in English as The Lesser Evil. Klemperer, a brilliant linguist and social critic, and before the war a German nationalist, survived the Third Reich as a Jew in Germany (producing his more famous diaries, and the brilliant Language of the Third Reich), became a high-status member of the Communist regime, ending up in the East German Parliament (as an arts delegate). Everything you could ever want to know about the corruption of the mind is in these two works.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>There are too many great chroniclers of Communism to count, but three of my favorites are Lev Navrozov, Vladimir Bukovsky, and&hellip; Victor Klemperer, whose East German diaries are perhaps his most interesting. Klemperer, no communist before the war, actually wound up in the East German parliament. If you think your grip on reality is so strong that you could never serve a criminal regime or choose a greater evil over a lesser one, perhaps you are a better man than Klemperer. But who dares such a claim should first read his books.</p></div>

During this period of expansion, the USG was transformed into an organization that is run by permanent employees of the federal bureaucracy, the media, and academia (readers of Mencius Moldbug will know this group as The Cathedral). This transformational process is The New Deal. Burnham will help you understand the infiltration and rise to power of these organizations. McCarthyism represents a backlash against this transform, but it was too late. McCarthy was correct but even the truth was not powerful enough to defeat this new power structure – Evans will show you what happens when you fight The Cathedral.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/NavrozovAndreiTheGingerbreadRaceALifeInTheClosingWorldOnceCalledFree"><h3>The Gingerbread Race A Life in the Closing World Once by Andrei Navrozov</h3></a>
  <div><p>Recommended by Moldbug:</p><p>A Navrozov moment is a moment when you realize that the university, which was established as a refuge whose purpose was to pursue truth without regard for the opinions of the world, has become a power center whose purpose is to impose its own opinions on the world. As such it has no more use for independent thought than a dog has for beets.</p><p>The name honors this piece by Andrei Navrozov, which I&rsquo;m sure that, since he is a gentleman, he and his notorious pit-bull lawyers will allow me to steal. It&rsquo;s from his Gingerbread Race, which is not nearly as hard to find as it should be. Navrozov, son of the equally eccentric and perceptive Lev Navrozov, is a little too concerned with Skull and Bones and not nearly concerned enough with paragraph breaks, but he is basically a sane man and a brilliant raconteur, and the following is not at all atypical.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The trick of being tiresome,&rsquo; said Voltaire, &lsquo;is to tell all.&rsquo; The great historic upheavals that are the reference points of my childhood and adolescence may all be looked up in Britannica, which can equally be relied upon to furnish a superficial history of Yale, or of American universities generally. Abstractions like cultural diversity, liberal education and academic freedom have lost none of their popularity since the day I first encountered them in the admissions brochures. What no encyclopedia can be expected to suggest, however, is that what paranoid misfits like Mill and Orwell have always known to be true, namely that when, for one reason or other, a society lets go of the adversarial principle I have compared with the human soul, it develops therapeutic myths of itself which present its weaknesses as strengths, myths that displace truth in the pages of encyclopedias and allow the many to diagnose the few as paranoid misfits. The popular abstractions I place among the constituent myths of modern civilization&rsquo;s public religion are not outright lies, of course. They are what Mill called half-truths, noting that &lsquo;not the violent conflict between parts of the truth, but the quiet suppression of half of it, is the formidable evil&rsquo;. By absorbing the violent shock of dissent once represented by such abstractions into its placidly gaseous whole, the religion quietly dissolves potential opposition, with the consequence that, in Mill&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;truth itself ceases to have the effect of truth by being exaggerated into falsehood&rsquo;.</p>

  <div><p>Description from <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2008/03/26/writer-on-the-storm/print">Reason maagazine</a>:</p><p>Carl Oglesby was the Middle American—and emphatically libertarian—voice of this New Left. The Akron, Ohio, native and son of a rubber-factory worker was a 30-year-old playwright laboring for a defense contractor in Ann Arbor, Michigan, when a series of events thrust him into the presidency of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the largest and most influential bloc of the student protest movement. Through marches and teach-ins and protests, SDS kicked up a ruckus in what Oglesby called “the assembly-line universities of this Pepsi Generation.”</p><p>In his influential 1967 essay “Vietnamese Crucible,” Oglesby praised “the libertarian tradition” and insisted that the New Left draw nourishment from the heritage of “humanistic individualism and voluntaristic associational action.” He disdained socialism, for as he explains in his most recent book, “In the eyes of a generation raised on George Orwell, big government seemed too much the suspect of choice in contemporary crime to be trusted as the manager of social progress.”</p><p>Oglesby parleyed and parried and partied with everyone from the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre to the libertarian economist Murray Rothbard to a young Wellesley activist named Hillary Rodham. He had the time of his life. But by 1968, SDS had splintered into rival factions. Oglesby represented what he called “SDS’s freewheeling participatory democracy” against the violent Weathermen, whose public face was the cheerleader turned bomb-cheerer Bernardine Dohrn. The Weathermen won the competition by losing: SDS was destroyed, in Oglesby’s words, by “the toxic blend of road rage and comic book Marxism…of the Weathermen.” The blast that shattered the student left was detonated on March 6, 1970, when three Weathermen died in a Greenwich Village townhouse after their homemade nail bomb accidentally went off.</p><p>The movement splintered; Oglesby burned out. He went on to record two folk albums, suffused with a kind of Beat Americana and elegiac—and nonpolitical—lyricism. Always haunted by the assassination of John F. Kennedy, he analyzed elite politics in The Yankee and Cowboy War (1976), in which he viewed American history from the JFK assassination to Watergate as a struggle between Eastern (Yankee) and Southwestern (Cowboy) interests. Oglesby would write two more books about the Kennedy killing.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/DiaryOfAManInDespair"><h3>Diary of a Man in Despair by Friedrich Reck-Malleczewen</h3></a>
  <div><p>Recommended by Mencius Moldbug.</p><p>From an Amazon review:</p><p>The title is a calumny. As his translator, Paul Rubens, points out, Friedrich Reck-Malleczewen was a prophet - not in the vulgar sense of one who predicts future events, but a prophet after the fashion of Jeremiah, William Blake and Dostoyevsky: one who comments on the present from the perspective of the Most High. As such, even when his own death is imminent, Reck most certainly does not despair. Like the three individuals mentioned above, he is angered, disgusted, saddened and horrified by what he sees around him; his journal is filled with images of Calvary, the plague, and the Apocalypse; yet he continually strives to see his own and his country&rsquo;s ordeal as a time of suffering and repentance which must be endured to make way for a new and better world. None of which is to say that his thinking is &ldquo;mystical&rdquo; in the sense of being vague or escapist; indeed, the immense value of Reck&rsquo;s diary, both as literature and as a historical document, lies in its brilliant combination of sharp observation and lucid analysis. Although he makes the all-too-common error of lumping in the plotters of 20 July 1944 with the many opportunists who tried to dissociate themselves from the regime as defeat began to loom, Reck&rsquo;s analytical passages offer as clear and concrete a picture of the corruption underlying Hitler&rsquo;s Germany as any historian I have encountered. Telling details of life in the Third Reich - the omnipresent thuggery and tale-bearing, the forced barracks-gymnasium atmosphere, the all-pervasive lies and propaganda - spring out of every page through tartly written anecdotes and vignettes. The peculiar detestability of the Nazi functionaries - frustrated schoolteachers and jumped-up mailmen posing as masters of the world - is described and analysed with perception and admirable loathing. This elderly, conservative, royalist aristocrat - a member of a class who, because they did not support the Weimar Republic, are too often labelled supporters of the Nazis - displays a courage, intelligence, breadth of culture and (I cannot emphasise it enough) a faith which makes his journal as moving a human document as the more famous diary of Anne Frank.</p></div>

  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2010/05/solzhenitsyn-as-breathing-and.html">Recommended by Moldbug</a></p><p>In honor of this incident, I thought I&rsquo;d post an excerpt from Alexander Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s As Breathing And Consciousness Return, the first essay in his samizdat anthology From Under The Rubble.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a pity I don&rsquo;t have time to type more of this piece, but From Under The Rubble can be bought for a penny at many fine online bookstores. Inside the ellipses is Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s great attack on Andrei Sakharov, for his &ldquo;socialism with a human face&rdquo; moderate dissidence. </p>
<blockquote><p>Solzhenitsyn says: reject all the lies, not just those that contradict &ldquo;world progressive opinion.&rdquo; The &ldquo;world progressive opinion&rdquo; of 1973 being not at all different from the mind of Harvard, 2010. Indeed for the reader of 2010, Solzhenitsyn does not attack Sakharov so much as pass through him - like a bullet through a stick of butter. Remaining lethally relevant, as Sakharov&rsquo;s Brezhnev-lite bromides grow comically dated: The transition from free speech to enforced silence is no doubt painful. What torment for a living society, used to thinking for itself, to lose from some decreed date the right to express itself in print and in public, to bite back its words year in and year out, in friendly conversation and even under the family roof.</p><p>But the way back, which our country will soon face - the return of breathing and consciousness, the transition from silence to free speech - will also prove difficult and slow, and just as painful, because of the gulf of utter incomprehension which will suddenly yawn between fellow-countrymen, even those of the same generation and place of origin, even members of the same close circle.</p>

  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/08/secret-of-anti-americanism.html">Mentioned by Moldbug</a>:</p><p>It&rsquo;s interesting to read classic works of American anti-Communism today, like the all-time Bircher bestseller, John Stormer&rsquo;s None Dare Call It Treason, which sold seven million copies in its day. From the benefit of hindsight, almost all the details in the book are correct - Castro and Mao really were Communist bastards, and so on - and at this low level its grip on reality is far stronger than anything which was taught at Harvard in its time.</p><p>But the overarching paranoid theory of anti-Communism, the idea that all American institutions had been infiltrated by the devious agents of Moscow, strikes us as nonsensical today - and rightly so. If you can&rsquo;t afford a copy of None Dare Call It Treason - a bargain at only one cent, plus shipping - you can see Eric Raymond, who is an ass but certainly no dummy, promoting this theory as recently as 2005.</p><p>What Raymond sees, and what the anti-Communists saw, was the remarkable alignment of Universalism with the interests of the KGB. True enough. What they missed was that they&rsquo;d drawn the tail wagging the dog.</p><p>It is not that the American left was the tool of Moscow. In fact, it was the other way around. From day one, the Soviet Union was the pet experiment of the bien-pensants. It was Looking Backward in Cyrillic. It was the client state to end all client states.</p></div>

  <div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Odd-Man-Out-Truman-Origins/dp/1574883437">From an Amazon review</a>:</p><p>The conventional interpretation of the Korean War is that Kim Il Sung provoked the war, and forced a reluctant Stalin to support him, and that the United States was surprised both by the North Korean offensive of June 1950 and by the subsequent Chinese offensive of November 1950. In this important new book, Thornton offers a compelling argument for a re-examination of this version of events.</p><p>Thornton begins with a logical examination of the geopolitical interests of the principal actors: the USSR, the PRC, the USA, and North and South Korea. He shows that Mao wanted good relations &ldquo;with all nations&rdquo; - including the US - but needed Soviet assistance to seize Taiwan. Stalin, however, regarded a Sino-American rapprochement as his worst nightmare, and responded by unleashing North Korea against South Korea. Stalin calculated that this move would inevitably bring the US and China into conflict, and thus forestall his nightmare scenario. (In his discussion of Mao and Stalin, Thornton builds on such works as Goncharov and Lewis&rsquo;s &ldquo;Uncertain Partners&rdquo;.) The US, for its part, wanted to keep Russia and China apart, and in late 1949 began backing away from support from Taiwan, which was of course the main obstacle to good US relations with the PRC. This policy was subsequently re-evaluated when Washington understood that the Soviets and the Chinese had reached an understanding of their own.</p><p>Thornton demonstrates that Stalin was the principal instigator of the Korean War, not Kim Il Sung - the tail did not wag the dog. The Soviets planned the June offensive, and supplied the North Korean Army with the weapons without which no attack could take place.</p></div>

  <div><p><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/05/utley-rule-and-bdh-alliance.html">Recommended by Moldbug</a>:</p><p>Surely one of the most grievously forgotten authors of the 20th century is Freda Utley. In the immortal words of Rutger Hauer, Utley &ldquo;saw things&hellip; you people wouldn&rsquo;t believe&rdquo; - she moved to Moscow as a Communist true believer in the 1930s, lost her husband to the Gulag, and never remarried. Her honesty and fearlessness did not make her popular, especially when she spoke out against American abuses in the occupation of Germany, or against Maoism 40 years before it was fashionable. </p><p>As Utley put it in her compulsively readable autobiography, Odyssey of a Liberal, her friend Edith Hamilton once warned her &ldquo;not to expect the material rewards of unrighteousness, while engaged in the pursuit of truth.&rdquo; No such rewards appeared, and today her books are utterly obscure. But when all our &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; are Utley&rsquo;s kind, as they once were and surely will be again, I&rsquo;ll be proud to wear the label.</p><p>Perhaps Utley&rsquo;s most acute realization in Odyssey, though on a trivial subject, is when she notices that her friend Bertrand Russell always uses the word &ldquo;we&rdquo; to refer to the government. She points out that this little linguistic tic is an unmistakable mark of any ruling class.</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/WaughEvelynBlackMischief"><h3>Black Mischief by Evelyn Waugh</h3></a>
  <div><p>From an Amazon review:</p><p>&ldquo;Black Mischief&rdquo; is not a safe book; it delves into racial and political divides as wide now as then and lets you know its author isn&rsquo;t aboard for any of that 21st-century sensitivity rot. Despite or perhaps because of this it is a good book, perhaps a great book, and worthy of your time.</p><p>In the island nation of Azania, just off the coast of East Africa, Oxford-educated Emperor Seth attempts to force his backward, war-torn nation to emulate the West. Help arrives in the form of a British ne&rsquo;er-do-well, Basil Seal, &ldquo;a man of progress and culture&rdquo; as Seth styles him. This of course means Seal is trouble as well.</p><p>As I read deeper into &ldquo;Black Mischief&rdquo;, I was struck by two things. One was how easily it flowed, not only with Waugh&rsquo;s always elegant prose but the plot itself. Waugh isn&rsquo;t ordinarily so clean a scenarist. The other was how like Joseph Conrad&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nostromo&rdquo; this is, making the same points about First World meeting Third World. Except where &ldquo;Nostromo&rdquo; was clumsy and dry, Waugh sells his message with wit and surreal humor.</p><p>He even goes to the trouble of mapping out Azania, which helps a lot given it is a nation entirely of Waugh&rsquo;s own imagining. As the characters cross its expanse, I found myself referring back to the map in front and enjoying how well it matched up with the narrative.</p><p>When I picked up &ldquo;Black Mischief&rdquo;, I was concerned about the obvious racial aspects. Waugh was capable of writing hurtful things about blacks as well as other groups Waugh experienced from a distance. &ldquo;Remote People,&rdquo; published in 1931 just one year before &ldquo;Black Mischief&rdquo;, presents Africans in the role of bloody-minded savages.</p><p>Well, there are plenty of savages in &ldquo;Black Mischief&rdquo;, too, only most of the ones we get to know best and like least are European. Seth begins to go wrong when he tries to imitate his imagined betters, picking up and dropping one faddish craze after another, whether it be autogyros or universal contraception. &ldquo;THROUGH STERILITY TO CULTURE&rdquo; reads one banner.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll discover every damn modern thing if we don&rsquo;t find him a woman damn quick,&rdquo; an accomplish of Seal complains. Not that Seth&rsquo;s gullible. The West is just too full of bad ideas.</p><p>Take a couple of middle-aged animal-rights activists who walk through Azania&rsquo;s impoverished streets throwing scraps for dogs and complain when children try to make off with them instead: &ldquo;Greedy little wretches.&rdquo;</p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/ChaundhuriNiradThyHandGreatAnarchIndia19211952"><h3>Thy Hand, Great Anarch by Nirad Chaundhuri</h3></a>
  <div><p>Amazon review:</p><p>The first volume of Chaudhuri&rsquo;s memoirs, The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian , 1951, met with lavish praise (&ldquo;the one great book to have come out of the Indo-English encounter&rdquo;V. S. Naipaul), general admiration and some harsh criticism, particularly from Indian nationalists. This second volume, almost 1000 pages long, perhaps surpasses it, in the depth, range and authority of its socio-historical commentary and the pungency of its language.</p><p>Chaudhuri&rsquo;s fundamental thesis is that the British Raj in its 19th century heyday brought the breath of life to Indian, and more specifically Bengali, culture, while there is more corruption and lawlessness in India now than there was then. Yet he lambasts the British for the arrogant racism that hastened the demise of their Indian empire, and running though his book like an ominous and finally tragic groundswell is the seemingly ineradicable hatred of Hindus and Muslims for each other, and of both for the British. There are iconoclastic portraits of Gandhi, Nehru and Mountbatten, a touching one of Tagore and a shrewd appraisal of nationalist leader Subhas Bose whose hatred of British rule threw him into the arms of Hitler.</p><p>Among major events described are Gandhi&rsquo;s non-cooperation campaigns and the political wranglings that preceded, then the bloodshed that followed Britain&rsquo;s &ldquo;abandonment&rdquo; of India in 1947. This is a courageous, provocative, sometimes provoking but unquestionably major book by a fiery polymath, now in his 91st year, who seems as much at home with Beethoven, Pascal and Cicero as with his compatriot Tagore. </p></div>

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/WilliamsENTheAncienRegimeInEurope"><h3>The Ancien Regime in Europe by EN Williams</h3></a>
  <div><p>From a goodreads review:</p><p>An old-fashioned history, for better or worse. The better, here, outweighs the worse quite easily. </p><p>Better: Williams can write very nicely at every scale&ndash;fluid sentences, organized paragraphs, organized sections, organized chapters. He tells you the facts, as best he can understand them, before he preaches at you about how previous historians got it wrong, thus avoiding all the horrors of contemporary historiography, which often tells you about how wrong the accepted story is <em>before they tell you about either the accepted story or the bare historical facts</em>. In other words, if you are not a professional historian of the ancien regime, you will learn a lot more reading this than you will reading, for instance, Tim Blanning&rsquo;s perfectly good &lsquo;Pursuit of Glory.&rsquo;</p><p>There are some problems with the book&rsquo;s organization: Williams just takes each of the &lsquo;great powers&rsquo; in turn. So you get the Netherlands, then Spain, then France, then Russia, then Prussia, then Austria, then Britain. That is the book. So there&rsquo;s a bit too much repetition, and the domestic stuff works better than the international. </p><p>Worse: The book was published in 1970; it&rsquo;s pretty outdated. But even then it must have been a bit controversial. Williams has a very Weberian understanding of economic and social development, and is a little too prone to saying that such and such a city/area/country was economically backward because nobody there had the right attitude. If only the priests would stop telling people that poverty was noble, capitalism would have been able to take over the world so much more quickly! Well, we can argue about that. A greater concern is that Williams holds to a very strong <em>INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION CHANGED EVERYTHING IN A WEEK</em> understanding of the world, which most economists and a goodly number of historians would dispute. The most disturbing aspect of the book is the perspective from which Williams writes. I&rsquo;m sure <em>he</em> didn&rsquo;t think this, but he writes as if the only criterion for value is how well a deed or development serves to consolidate the state and its economy. Thus he writes with chilling complacency about Ireland being intentionally turned into a wasteland for one paragraph, while otherwise lauding the greatness and brilliance of the post-restoration English state. Let&rsquo;s not even talk about where the money came from for that state, by the way. </p></div>

  <div><p><a href="https://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/04/27/review-of-lincoln-the-man-by-edgar-lee-masters/">Recommended by Foseti</a>:</p><p>Both the propaganda wing of the Democratic Party and the intellectual wing of the Republican Party (insert joke here) want you to love Abraham Lincoln. If you’re like me, this is enough to convince you that you almost certainly don’t love Abraham Lincoln. There is, perhaps, no better tour guide on an anti-Lincoln journey than Masters.</p><p>Masters’ Lincoln is the first truly modern statesman (that is to say a wonderful politician, but not an actual statesman in the sense that he’s not leader and doesn’t have a governing philosophy). Lincoln lacks vision, conviction and any philosophical foundation. He says what needs to be said to please the crowd he’s in front of and what he says changes to fit the crowd. He has no fixed principles and no view of how government should work. He seeks to achieve and retain power. Perhaps that’s why he’s worshipped by both American political parties today. But, we’re getting ahead of ourselves &hellip;</p><p>The book is really about why the Civil War was fought. There are basically three competing theories: 1) ending slavery; 2) preserving the Union; and 3) ending federalism. The third is, of course the Southern position, and it’s Masters’.</p></div>

<blockquote><p>The educated leaders of the New Freedom were steeped in British literature more deeply than the old-fashioned politicians. As a student of domestic government, President Wilson throughout his life had been profoundly influenced by English ideas and political institutions; while our rare experts in the elegant fields of foreign policy had modelled themselves for a generation upon the giants of British liberal imperialism. Our own imperialist adventure at the turn of the century had been largely in imitation of those romantic splendors; Mr. Kipling himself had sung us forward to &lsquo;take up the white man&rsquo;s burden,&rsquo; and the statesmen of those years - Roosevelt and Lodge, Root, John Hay, Taft, Leonard Wood - had rejoiced to create an empire almost as glorious and perhaps even more righteous than that of Great Britain.</p>

Special attention is directed to fundamental differences between medieval and modern attitudes toward poetry, and to the significance of these differences for an approach to medieval art.

Erec and Enide, newly married and lost in erotic, conjugal bliss, are brought back to reality when gossip suggests that Erec, son of a king, prefers life at home to the existence of a fearless, heroic knight. Celtic legend, classical motifs, and ecclesiastical elements are masterfully interwoven in this tale, whose colloquial translation brings to life the clashing sounds of battle, de Troyes&rsquo;s multiple poetic tones and colorful expressions, and the rhyme and meter of the original. Both scholars and general readers will surely enjoy this story of the Erec’s quest for honor, glory, and the Arthurian way.</p></div>

  <div><p><a href="http://www.henrydampier.com/2015/04/the-cult-of-the-virgin-mary-and-romance/#comment-2284">Recommended by Izak</a></p><p>If Christians want to rehabilitate their understanding of romantic love, they should probably first start by realizing that the “romantic love” they’re influenced by was largely a literary invention from medieval times and contained a series of gestures that had no real basis in real life. Moreover, the courtly love tradition was frequently mocked during the middle ages and even satirized for how badly it went against the teachings of the church fathers. I would argue — and I realize this is controversial — that medieval Christianity was actually better equipped to handle the harsh realities of human biodiversity than most Western Christians are today. The reason was because they felt that mankind was truly fallen, and so human nature was something automatically bad. This allowed them greater freedom to explore the depravity of the human condition with no moral compunctions. When renaissance humanism came along, human nature started to be seen as a good thing, and so the idea of viewing humanity as “fallen” became a compromised position.</p><p>And this is a big, important issue, because when we think of romance, we think of chivalry — knights from medieval times. We think of goofy dudes genuflecting and saying “m’lady” and stuff. The medievals understood human sexuality and talked about it with much greater freedom than we do now (nowadays we crassly display it, but we don’t talk about it in a way that rises above the level of banality). They not only had better morals about it, but they had a better grasp of its reality.</p><p>If ppl don’t believe me, I would suggest that they read the following pieces of evidence.</p><p>(Primary sources) 1. The Romance of the Rose (continuation by Jean de Meun) 2. The Wife of Bath’s Prologue (Chaucer) 3. Eric and Enide (Chretien de Troyes) 4. Discussions on women from medieval estates satires (The Mirror of the Mankind by John Gower being probably the most solid example)</p><p>The primary sources are not too crass or vulgar, but they definitely constitute “red pill wisdom” or whatever. It is shocking how relevant these texts are, even today. Read “The Advice of Friend” from Romance of the Rose, and you will hear every goofy-ass male feminist you’ve ever met speaking through this character’s voice.</p></div>

The first two are pale pencil sketches of less then two pages each. In the first autobiography Yevgeny writes &quot;And so you insist on my autobiography. But you will have to content yourself with a purely external view, with perhaps a fleeting glance into darkened windows: I rarely invite anyone to come inside. And from the outside you will not see much.</p><p>The third autobiography, a large detailed painting containing many narrative brushstrokes makes one eager to continue reading to better understand the way Yevgeny saw the world, especially Russia and the arresting affect it had on its artists. Yevgeny saw that some artists became propagandists; others became dull craftsmen not wanting to rock the boat. And then there were a few, who like Yevgeny, wrote imaginative, independent, boisterous pieces that went of like a bomb shooting shrapnel into the bureaucracy; their writings led to the gulags or exile.</p></div>

  <div><p>From an Amazon review:</p><p>This book is a delight to read, and throws light on the Supreme Court in the momentous court year of 1936-37 when the Court was saved by Justice Roberts breaking away from the conservative wing of the Court and upholding New Deal laws which, if they had been held unconstitutional, might well have resulted in changes to the Supreme Court such as FDR had requested. The account by John Knox of how he came to be Justice McReynolds&rsquo; law clerk and the odd life had to lead as such clerk is of much interest. I have seldom read a memoir of greater interest than is this one. Knox himself is a most unusual person, having a effrontery which amazes one looking at it from the viewpoint of history. The book is magnificently edited, with citations which enable one in this computer age to look up the cases mentioned and live the time with Knox. Knox&rsquo;s subsequent career is also of interest, and poignant. This book is a winner, and anyone interested in Supreme Court history will find reading this book extremely rewarding</p></div>

Well, it turns out that she was born Ekatarina Jung and her name was adapted to American tastes.</p><p>The book gave a very vivid picture of a young Jewish girl/adolescent encountering the growing intrusion of the Soviet system into every aspect of her moral/intellectual life. Young gives vivid examples of the moral compromises she was compelled to make to prevent severe reprisals on herself or her family. Young never spares herself from criticism of actions she felt compelled to make.</p><p>It was obvious from the text that the Jung family were not observant Jews. There was no difficulty in consuming pork products and no attempt to develop a distinct Jewish identity. The book&rsquo;s statement that the vast majority of Soviet Jews would have been delighted to become the most loyal of Soviet citizens, if only the system would allow them, is telling. The Jung family enjoyed a comfortable life by Soviet standards. The decision for the family to emigrate came with difficulty. Only the increasing intrusion of the state into their private life pushed them to take the decision to emigrate.</p><p>I read Young&rsquo;s account of her childhood with growing admiration. She became well versed in Russian literature as well as from many foreign sources. Some of these works were banned and the family took considerable risk in keeping them in their apartment. Young was able to become fluent in English, German, and French as well as her native tongue. Apparently, she was able to master any subject that caught her interest. While in Rome awaiting her visa to emigrate to the United States, Young picked up a considerable understanding of Italian as well.</p></div>
